# attendenceapp
This is a simple attendance-taking application designed for teachers to efficiently record student attendance. The app presents a clear and user-friendly interface with the following key features:

Student List: Displays a list of students with their roll numbers and names.

Attendance Status: For each student, the teacher can quickly mark them as 'Present' (green), 'Absent' (red), or 'Late' (yellow) by tapping on their attendance status. The teacher needs to tap it to change the state.
Save Attendance: The teacher can save the attendance data for the current date, printing it to the console to review the data. This code doesn't support persistence, so the data are not saved on disk.
